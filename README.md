# Guessing Game

This is a game that will listen to the user's voice, using vocie recognition, and can check if their answers is close to the 
number that the app made up. The range of numbers that the app can choose from is 1 to 100.
For example if the winning number is 45, and the user guesses 27 then the app will display **GO HIGHER**. 
This also works if the user is over the winning number, as the app will display **GO LOWER**.
Of course if they get the right answer then the game will congratulate the user for winning the guessing game,
and they will be prompted if they would like to play another round.

## How to Run The App

The first step that must be taken it to clone the repo from git. The second step is to open a live server with the app, 
which will open a new page on chrome that displays the site.
